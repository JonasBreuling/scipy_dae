    """Solve an initial value problem for a system of differential algebraic 
    equations (DAE's).

    This function numerically integrates a system of implicit ordinary 
    differential equations given an initial value::

        f(t, y, y') = 0
        y(t0) = y0
        y'(t0) = y_dot0

    Here t is a 1-D independent variable (time), y(t) is an N-D vector-valued 
    function (state), y'(t) is an N-D vector-valued function (state 
    derivative) and an N-D vector-valued function f(t, y, y') determines the 
    implicit differential algebraic equations.
    The goal is to find y(t) and y'(t) approximately satisfying the differential
    algebraic equations, given initial values y(t0)=y0 and y'(t0)=y_dot0.

    Some of the solvers support integration in the complex domain, but note
    that the function f must be complex-differentiable (satisfy Cauchy-Riemann 
    equations [11]_).
    To solve a problem in the complex domain, pass y0 or y_dot0 with a complex 
    data type. Another option always available is to rewrite your problem for 
    real and imaginary parts separately.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Function defining the DAE system: ``f(t, y, y_dot) = 0``. The calling 
        signature is ``fun(t, y, y_dot)``, where ``t`` is a scalar and 
        ``y, y_dot`` are ndarrays with 
        ``len(y) = len(y_dot) = len(y0) = len(y_dot0)``. Additional 
        arguments need to be passed if ``args`` is used (see documentation of
        ``args`` argument). ``fun`` must return an array of the same shape as
        ``y`` and ``y_dot``. See `vectorized` for more information.
    t_span : 2-member sequence
        Interval of integration (t0, t_bound). The solver starts with t=t0 and
        integrates until it reaches t=t_bound. Both t0 and t_bound must be 
        floats or values interpretable by the float conversion function.
    y0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial state. For problems in the complex domain, pass `y0` with a
        complex data type (even if the initial value is purely real).
    y_dot0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial derivative. For problems in the complex domain, pass `y_dot0` 
        with a complex data type (even if the initial value is purely real).
    method : string or `DaeSolver`, optional
        Integration method to use:

            * 'Radau': Implicit Runge-Kutta method of the Radau IIA family of
              order 5 [4]_. The error is controlled with a third-order accurate
              embedded formula. A cubic polynomial which satisfies the
              collocation conditions is used for the dense output.
            * 'BDF': Implicit multi-step variable-order (1 to 5) method based
              on a backward differentiation formula for the derivative
              approximation [5]_. The implementation follows the one described
              in [6]_. A quasi-constant step scheme is used and accuracy is
              enhanced using the NDF modification. Can be applied in the
              complex domain.

        You can also pass an arbitrary class derived from `DaeSolver` which
        implements the solver.
    t_eval : array_like or None, optional
        Times at which to store the computed solution, must be sorted and lie
        within `t_span`. If None (default), use points selected by the solver.
    dense_output : bool, optional
        Whether to compute a continuous solution. Default is False.
    events : callable, or list of callables, optional
        Events to track. If None (default), no events will be tracked.
        Each event occurs at the zeros of a continuous function of time and
        state. Each function must have the signature ``event(t, y)`` where
        additional argument have to be passed if ``args`` is used (see
        documentation of ``args`` argument). Each function must return a
        float. The solver will find an accurate value of `t` at which
        ``event(t, y(t)) = 0`` using a root-finding algorithm. By default,
        all zeros will be found. The solver looks for a sign change over
        each step, so if multiple zero crossings occur within one step,
        events may be missed. Additionally each `event` function might
        have the following attributes:

            terminal: bool or int, optional
                When boolean, whether to terminate integration if this event occurs.
                When integral, termination occurs after the specified the number of
                occurences of this event.
                Implicitly False if not assigned.
            direction: float, optional
                Direction of a zero crossing. If `direction` is positive,
                `event` will only trigger when going from negative to positive,
                and vice versa if `direction` is negative. If 0, then either
                direction will trigger event. Implicitly 0 if not assigned.

        You can assign attributes like ``event.terminal = True`` to any
        function in Python.
    # vectorized : bool, optional
    #     Whether `fun` can be called in a vectorized fashion. Default is False.

    #     If ``vectorized`` is False, `fun` will always be called with ``y`` of
    #     shape ``(n,)``, where ``n = len(y0)``.

    #     If ``vectorized`` is True, `fun` may be called with ``y`` of shape
    #     ``(n, k)``, where ``k`` is an integer. In this case, `fun` must behave
    #     such that ``fun(t, y)[:, i] == fun(t, y[:, i])`` (i.e. each column of
    #     the returned array is the time derivative of the state corresponding
    #     with a column of ``y``).

    #     Setting ``vectorized=True`` allows for faster finite difference
    #     approximation of the Jacobian by methods 'Radau' and 'BDF', but
    #     will result in slower execution for other methods and for 'Radau' and
    #     'BDF' in some circumstances (e.g. small ``len(y0)``).
    args : tuple, optional
        Additional arguments to pass to the user-defined functions.  If given,
        the additional arguments are passed to all user-defined functions.
        So if, for example, `fun` has the signature ``fun(t, y, a, b, c)``,
        then `jac` (if given) and any event functions must have the same
        signature, and `args` must be a tuple of length 3.
    **options
        Options passed to a chosen solver. All options available for already
        implemented solvers are listed below.
    first_step : float or None, optional
        Initial step size. Default is `None` which means that the algorithm
        should choose.
    max_step : float, optional
        Maximum allowed step size. Default is np.inf, i.e., the step size is not
        bounded and determined solely by the solver.
    rtol, atol : float or array_like, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerances. The solver keeps the local error
        estimates less than ``atol + rtol * abs(y)``. Here `rtol` controls a
        relative accuracy (number of correct digits), while `atol` controls
        absolute accuracy (number of correct decimal places). To achieve the
        desired `rtol`, set `atol` to be smaller than the smallest value that
        can be expected from ``rtol * abs(y)`` so that `rtol` dominates the
        allowable error. If `atol` is larger than ``rtol * abs(y)`` the
        number of correct digits is not guaranteed. Conversely, to achieve the
        desired `atol` set `rtol` such that ``rtol * abs(y)`` is always smaller
        than `atol`. If components of y have different scales, it might be
        beneficial to set different `atol` values for different components by
        passing array_like with shape (n,) for `atol`. Default values are
        1e-3 for `rtol` and 1e-6 for `atol`.
    jac : (array_like, array_like), (sparse_matrix, sparse_matrix), callable or None, optional
        Jacobian matrices of the right-hand side of the system with respect
        to y and y', required by the 'Radau' and 'BDF' method. The
        Jacobian matrices have shape (n, n) and their elements (i, j) are equal to
        ``d f_i / d y_j`` and ``d f_i / d y_j'``, respectively.  There are 
        three ways to define the Jacobian:

            * If (array_like, array_like) or (sparse_matrix, sparse_matrix) 
              the Jacobian matrices are assumed to be constant.
            # TODO: Add constant J_y'!
            * If callable, the Jacobians are assumed to depend on both
              t, y and y'; it will be called as ``jac(t, y, y')``, as necessary.
              Additional arguments have to be passed if ``args`` is
              used (see documentation of ``args`` argument).
              For 'Radau' and 'BDF' methods, the return value might be a
              tuple of sparse matrices.
            * If None (default), the Jacobians will be approximated by
              finite differences.

        It is generally recommended to provide the Jacobians rather than
        relying on a finite-difference approximation.
    jac_sparsity : array_like, sparse matrix or None, optional
        Defines a sparsity structure of the Jacobian matrix for a finite-
        difference approximation. Its shape must be (n, n). This argument
        is ignored if `jac` is not `None`. If the Jacobian has only few
        non-zero elements in *each* row, providing the sparsity structure
        will greatly speed up the computations [10]_. A zero entry means that
        a corresponding element in the Jacobian is always zero. If None
        (default), the Jacobian is assumed to be dense.

    Returns

    t : ndarray, shape (n_points,)
        Time points.
    y : ndarray, shape (n, n_points)

            *  0: The solver successfully reached the end of `tspan`.
            *  1: A termination event occurred.

    message : string
        Human-readable description of the termination reason.
